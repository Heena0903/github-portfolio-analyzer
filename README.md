GitHub Portfolio Analyzer — AI Recruiter Evaluation System
Problem

Recruiters review hundreds of GitHub profiles daily but evaluating engineering depth, consistency, documentation quality, and project impact manually is time-consuming and inconsistent.
Students often do not know:

How strong their GitHub portfolio is

What recruiters notice first

Which repositories need improvement

What concrete steps will make them recruiter-ready

Solution

GitHub Portfolio Analyzer is an AI-powered system that evaluates GitHub profiles using recruiter-style signals and generates:

Portfolio Score (0-100)

Engineering signal breakdown

Weak repositories detection

Recruiter-style hiring signal

Actionable improvement steps

The system provides structured, real-time evaluation using GitHub public APIs and AI feedback generation.
